HTML5 Jukebox is a PHP script that scans a directory and lists its contents as links. If a link leads to a MP3, M4A, WAV, MP4 and MOV file, it creates an HTML5 Audio player for it to play in. If the link is to a sub-directory, the next level down of contents is listed as links, thus enabling the nesting songs within albums within artists.

**Update
Added support for MOV and MP4 files.
